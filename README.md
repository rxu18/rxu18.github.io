# About me

I am a student at Harvard University studying Mathematics with a concurrent masters in Computer Science. I have previously interned at Zoom, Vertica and Jane Street.

Checkout my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/rxu18) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/richard-xu-07bb22b1/). I have a [blog](https://www.bccalculus.com) under construction. Contact me at *raxu* at *college* dot *harvard* dot *edu*.
